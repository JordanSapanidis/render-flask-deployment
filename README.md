ProfitSearcher is a tool designed to assist financial analysts in efficiently <b>gathering</b> key financial data—such as <b>net income</b>—from companies. 
With this program, users can quickly collect net income data spanning the last <b>30 quarters</b>, and export it as an <b>.xlsx</b> file for further analysis.
While this tool currently focuses on net income, it serves as a foundation for expanding into a more comprehensive financial analysis platform. 
By extending the program's logic, it could easily support additional financial accounts such as assets, liabilities, and more. 
This opens the door to performing in-depth company evaluations based on historical financial statements just by just by entering a company's ticker symbol.
In short, ProfitSearcher is just the <b>tip of the iceberg</b>
