ProfitSearcher is a tool designed to assist financial analysts in efficiently gathering key financial data—such as net income—from companies. 
With this program, users can quickly collect net income data spanning the last 30 quarters, and export it as an .xlsx file for further analysis.
While this tool currently focuses on net income, it serves as a foundation for expanding into a more comprehensive financial analysis platform. 
By extending the program's logic, it could easily support additional financial accounts such as assets, liabilities, and more. 
This opens the door to performing in-depth company evaluations based on historical financial statements just by just by entering a company's ticker symbol.
In short, ProfitSearcher is just the tip of the iceberg
